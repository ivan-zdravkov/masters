## Formulation of the problem
* The task is to compare the results of a 2D and 3D methods for 3D skeletal model mapping.

## Architecture
* Result showcase: An [Angular](https://angular.io/) Application and a simple .NET Core Server to serve the result data sets.
* Data gathering: A C# and a MATLAB applications using the [Nuitrack SDK](https://nuitrack.com/) and the [VNect](http://gvv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/VNect/) respectively, owned by the Ishikawa Senoo Laboratory.

## Used Technologies
* Angular
* HTML, CSS, JS
* .NET Core
